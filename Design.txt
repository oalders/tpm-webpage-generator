code/build-tree is used to turn XML files from the meetings directory
and generate HTML under the to.pm.org directory.

To decompose it into modules what would we need to model?

A meeting has a start date/time.
A meeting has a topic.
A meeting has a venue.
A meeting can have 0 or more leaders (think Fulko and Lightning Talks)
A meeting can have a synopsis (containing some subset of XHTML)
A meeting can have 0 or more talks.
A meeting can have 0 or more events (future - think December social).


A day can have 0 or more meetings (think Damian talk + social later).

A talk has a speaker
A talk has a title
A talk can have a description (containing some subset of XHTML)
