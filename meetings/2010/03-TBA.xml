		<title>An introduction to OPENapps</title>
		<description>
			<p>Imagine you create a web application and
			had the ability to sell it to many web
			site owners on the internet. Now imagine
			you could sell it without giving up the
			source code. OPENapps makes this happen.</p>

			<p>OPENapps is a powerful language agnostic platform allowing you
      to offer up web applications to a wide audience of website
      owners. OPENapps takes care of the things that developers
      typically find boring or repetitious such as billing and tracking;
      while at the same time providing robust technology for integration
			of your applications with content publishers sites.</p>

			<p>OPENapps is offering a limited developer beta to web developers
      who demonstrate that they have a killer app idea and a desire
			to implement it.</p>
