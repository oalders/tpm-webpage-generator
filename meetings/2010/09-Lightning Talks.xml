    <title>Perl &amp; Android - Getting GUI</title>
    <description>
      <p>
        Recently the Android Scripting Environment (ASE) was renamed Scripting
        Layer 4 Android.  The second release (SL4A r1) was just posted a
        couple days ago which address several issues from my talk a couple
        months back - including packaging scripts for distribution on the
        Android Market and creating GUI's with a WebView.

    <title>Pirate Party of Canada - One year on</title>
    <description>
      <p>
        Last year I described a bit about the Pirate Party of Canada and we
        had some short discussion on IP &amp; Privacy matters.  There's been a lot
        of activity in the last year and I'd be happy to talk a bit about what
        we've been up to.
