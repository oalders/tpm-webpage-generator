      <p>(Added from mailing list post after the talk)</p>
<p>I've posted last night's slides:  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/oalders/mangling">http://www.slideshare.net/oalders/mangling</a>  </p>

<p>If you're interested in Plack at all, I'd suggest you check out the repo and try it out. You should be up and running in just a few minutes.  Let me know if you run into any problems with it.</p>
