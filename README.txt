Simple programs & modules to generate TPM website pages.

The objective of this is to have a go with some simple perl techniques
so that I can do something simple with some new modules.  This is not
meant to be a "state of the art" web site generator...

  make critic # testing perl code
  make clean
  make
  make install

Prerequisites:

  Path::Class
  Readonly
  Template
  File::Find::Rule
  XML::Twig
  Date::Parse
  Perl::Critic (for make critic)

Todo:

  add --src-root
  add --output
  fix pod
  add tests
  mootools
