<h3>Damian and Perl: The Early Days</h3>

<p>
Since the early 1990s Dr. Damian Conway has worked in the Computer Science
and Software Engineering department of Monash University, Melbourne,
Australia, where he is now an Associate Professor.  Over the course of his
research he discovered the Perl programming language and neither Damian
nor Perl have been the same since.

<p>
In between 1997 and 2000 Damian became a regular fixture teaching at various
Perl conferences, contributed a wealth of modules to CPAN (the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network), and won for three straight years the Larry Wall
Award for Practical Utility. (Damian subsequently removed himself from 
competition in future years on account of his self-described "unfair
weirdness.")  He also wrote "Object Oriented Perl" (Manning, 1999,
ISBN 1884777791), which was quickly recognized as the definitive book on
the subject.

<h3>Damian and Yet Another Society</h3>

<p>
In the middle of 2000 several influential people in the Perl community 
decided to raise the funds to buy out Damian's contract from Monash University
for a year so that Damian could devote all of his considerable energies towards
the further promotion of the Perl language.  The fundraising was done under
the mantle of the newly formed "Yet Another Society" and through a combination
of corporate contributions and grassroots individual donations the US$80,000
needed was raised in only 2 weeks.  Damian became Larry's "right hand man"
in the Perl 6 effort, he continued with his many CPAN contributions, and 
he has circled the world -- several times -- to give free talks
to promote the Perl language. More information regarding Damian's YAS
Fellowship can be found at <a href=http://www.yetanother.org/damian/about.html>http://www.yetanother.org/damian/about.html</a>

<p>
While Damian's YAS Fellowship was scheduled only for the year of 2001, over
the course of the year it became obvious to everyone that this experiment
was successful and YAS readied itself to fund Damian for 2002, too.  Also,
the YAS Fellowship was extended to provide for Larry Wall and Dan Sugalski.
These three remarkable people form the core team for the creation of Perl 6,
the major reworking of the Perl language which is currently underway.  More
information regarding the 2002 YAS Fellowships (renamed Perl Foundation
Development Grants) can be found at
<a href=http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/benefits.html>
http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/benefits.html
</a>.  Though the Perl Foundation no longer supports Damian's work on a 
full time basis he remains very active in the organization.  His continued
devotion to the development of the Perl language and community is incredibly
valuable and he volunteers it freely.

<p>
Damian has often been called the "Mad Scientist of Perl."  He often refers to
himself as the "Court Jester of Perl."  Certainly, his public talks are wild,
zany and hillarious enough for him to earn either nickname. But he takes this
approach on purpose:  humour is a good way to get someone's attention,
and once Damian has your attention he can teach you something new about Perl.
And that's a job he's very serious about.
