<h2>TPM (aka Toronto.pm) Members</h2>
<h3>Richard Dice</h3>



<p>
Richard is the main organizer of the Toronto.pm YAPC::NA 2005 bid.  His
familiarity with Perl goes back to 1994, and since then he has programmed
extensively in Perl, written a few Perl books, delivered Perl corporate
training, and spoken on Perl at many conferences around North America.  He
has also been the organizer of three very successful trips to Toronto by
Damian Conway, in the summers of 2001, 2002 and 2004.  Richard has recently
graduated from the full-time MBA program at the University of Toronto's
Rotman School of Management.

<hr>
<h3>Indy Singh</h3>


<p>
Principle of IndigoStar software and author of 'perl2exe'.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Michael Graham</h3>

<p>
Michael Graham has been programming Perl for 7 years and has produced a couple of CPAN modules.  He has given talks on Testing and Database abstraction, both locally for the Toronto Perl Mongers and also at the 2003 YAPC::Canada in Ottawa.  
</p>


<hr>
<h3>John Macdonald</h3>



<p>
John Macdonald has been involved with Perl back to the days of its early releases on Usenet.  He is the co-author of Mastering Algorithms with Perl and has presented talks at The Perl Conference (in 1998 and 2000).
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Tom Legrady</h3>



<p>
Tom tried the new Perl 5 in 95 but was confused by all the backward
compatibility features.  But by 1999 he understood the one-true path: The
purpose of C is to provided Perl modules.
<p>
With one CPAN Module and a few workshop presentations to his credit, he is 
at the foot of the XP mountain, climbing slowly toward the monastery.
Speaking of which, at Perlmonks the name is <em>TomDLux</em>.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Shawn Griffith</h3>

<p>
Shaun has been programming Perl for 8 years, and is recently a former
member of DFW-PM. Deeply entrenched in semiconductor test, he's wasted most
of his talent translating vector files between languages. That is, when he's
not desperately trying to develop a better mousetrap for the <a
href="http://perl.plover.com/qotw/">Quiz of the Week</a>, sifting arcania at
<a href="www.perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a>, or wondering if Perl 6 will
cause dain bramage.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Eric Bower</h3>



<p>
Eric Bower is a newcomer to the Perl world.  He decided to join the Toronto Perl Mongers after another member described his experience with programming in Perl as "fun".  An embedded systems developer, Eric is more comfortable talking bits and bytes to hardware devices using C and assembler languages than the higher and nobler pursuits of Perl programmers.  Although proficient in Visual Basic, he has since learned, through Perl, the proper way to handle strings.  Eric's experience managing music groups, staging two rock concerts in Hamilton and other theatrical productions will help him develop the budget for the Toronto.pm YAPC::NA 2005 bid.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>T. Alex Beamish</h3>



<p>
Alex has worked with Perl since 1998 when he started building scripts to write SQL for him. This made a nice transition from programming in C, and he has worked on various web-related projects that use some combination of Perl and SQL since then. He pops up with alarming regularity at <a href="//perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a> under the cunning alias talexb, has been to three YAPCs and hopes to host his fifth.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>KW.pm (Kitchener/Waterloo) Members</h2>
<h3>Daniel Allen</h3>



<p>
Daniel has been a perl programmer since 1997, and has programmed a number of projects, some of which can be found at <a href="http://coder.com/">http://coder.com/</a>.  He was one of the many people behind the scenes at the inaugural <a href="http://yapc.ca/">http://yapc.ca/</a> in May 2003.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Stephanie Smith</h3>



<p>
A relative newcomer to perl and YAPC alike, Stephanie has had 3 years of experience in organizing small-to-medium sized conventions, serving as Registration Chair (2 years), Video Programming Chair (1 year), and on the Board of Directors as IT Director (1 year) for the Shoujocon anime convention. 
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Christopher Calzonetti</h3>



<p>
Easily recogonised by his sloping brow and small cranial capacity, Chris is frightened by things new and unfamiliar.  Perl is neither of these things to him.  He is, however, confused and frightened about YAPC but is willing to help out nevertheless.
</p>


<p>
When not sleeping, Christopher tends to work for a Marketing Company doing web design and system administration.
