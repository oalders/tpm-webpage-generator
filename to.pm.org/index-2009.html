      <p>

The Toronto Perl Mongers are hosting Yet Another Perl Conference,
North America, 2005, at the University of Toronto (89 Chestnut Street,
<a href=http://89chestnut.com/>http://89chestnut.com/</a> ), June
27-29, 2005.  This is one of the major Perl events world-wide, This
three day conference attracts upwards of 300 attendees from all over
North America (and usually a bunch from Europe) and costs only around
US$85.  Major Perl luminaries such as Larry Wall, Damian Conway,
Mark-Jason Dominus, Jon Orwant, (etc. etc.... the list goes on)
attend, or at least frequently have in past years.  The calibur of
speakers is excellent, and the socialization within the core of the
Perl community makes for a fantastic event.  Email na-help @ yapc.org
with any questions, comments, etc. you have regarding YAPC. (Note: the
date here are correct; the conference has been moved from a
previously-mentioned date block in order to accomodate venue
availability.)  <b>For more information go to

      <H2><a name="Meetings"></a>Meetings</H2>
      <p>We normally hold meetings on the last Thursday of each month.<br>
      <br>

      These meetings range from a single Perl theme to code reviews to
      rambling free-for-all discussions of things Perlish.&nbsp; We
      occasionally have meetings with special guests lecturing on or
      teaching about their specialties.&nbsp; After the meeting we
      usually go out for food and drinks.&nbsp; Perl hackers of all
      skill levels are invited. <br> <br>

      <b>Location</b>: 2 Bloor Street West, (usually) 8th or 16th floor.&nbsp;
      The room number will be announced on the mailing list a few days before
      the meeting.  It will also be left with the security desk in the
      building (main floor lobby) shortly before the meeting starts
      (i.e. around 6pm).</p>

      <p>
      <br>
      <b>Time</b>: 6:45 p.m.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Directions</b>: This building is on the north-west corner of
      Bloor and Yonge, accessible by subway from Bloor station. Pay
      parking is also ample in this area.<br> <br>

      <b>Security note</b>: After 5:30pm, the elevators are accessible
      only with a pass-card. After that time a fellow monger with a
      pass-card will escort you to the 8th or 16th floor.  A cell phone
      number will be left at the security desk (main floor lobby)
      that you can call up to get the pass-carded TPMer to come down to
      fetch you.<br>

<p>
<b>Location:</b>
2 Bloor Street West, 8th or 16th floor - A few days before the meeting an
announcement of the correct classroom will be made on the mailing list.
</p>

<p>
<b>Time:</b> 6:45 p.m.
</p>

<p>
            The elevators in the building are "locked down" after 5:30pm
            to people without building access cards.  Leading up to the
            meeting someone will come down to the main floor lobby every
            few minutes to ferry people upstairs.  There will be a
            number of scheduled trips:
</p>

<ul>
<li>17:30</li>
<li>18:00</li>
<li>18:30</li>
<li>18:45</li>
<li>19:00</li>
</ul>

<p>
            After 19:00, you can reach the access-card-carrying guy via
            a cell phone number that we'll leave with security in the
            front lobby.  The room and floor numbers will be left with
            security too.
</p>

<p>
            If any latecomers call up there will be a final group
            elevator run at 19:10.  After that, access will be ad-hoc;
            call up from security and somebody will try to come down and
            let you up.

Problem: How to replicate a facility I had in another language?
Its nice to be able to create/destroy and modify objects within a
program, but how can you dynamically and asynchrously view the object
instances in the middle of a run without adding debug code.
Solution: I will present a web browser based, object model browser,
that can reach into running applications and view and change objects
on the fly.
Soap provides the magic.

toward progressive social change. A well developed technology
structure is highly significant to the success of almost every
project, activist, and organization.<P>The decision to adapt open source technologies is based on the belief
that it is essential for the idea of "anti-oppression" to permeate
every level and activity of the project/organization, including the
tools, technology, and people employed. Reliability, security, long
term support, and choice are key advantages for choosing free
technology, while communication/feedback, testing, ease of use, and
functionality are areas that need continual improvement.<P>Linux, Perl, and other free/open source solutions used in various case
studies and environments were discovered to be not all feasible;
software had to be developed to make technically challenging tasks
accessible to a wide variety of users. I will be presenting
web-enabled applications and servers written in Perl, XML/XSL
processing in Perl, Code Generation techniques, Hardware Synthesis,
and paradigms in VHDL (a hardware description language).<P>I will be talking about technologies and applications that need to be
developed, as well as cultural changes that I think are needed in
making the tech community a more approachable, inclusive, innovative,
and progressive space. In my lust for sexier interfaces I will be
showing the ins and outs of my recent affairs with Python, Squeek, and
Mozilla's XUL based user interface.<P>

<p><b><span class="secHead"><a name="032004"></a>March 25 2004</span></b></p><p><b>Speaker: </b><strong>Tom Legrady</strong><br><b>Title: Pair Programming</b><br><b>Description:</b><br>The March TPM meeting will be an exercise in pair programming. If you have a laptop computer, preferably with Perl
installed, please bring it along.<P>The way I envision things working:<P>As people show up, they pair up into teams. This results in fairly
random teams, combining experienced and newer programmers. Unix/MS/Mac
should not be too significant a factor, though first-time exposure to
vi/emacs might be traumatic.<P>I will have a detailed list of requirements, corresponding to the use
case index cards. I will play the role of "client" and
"contact-with-the-client", clarifying any questions or problems.<P>The goal will be to implement certain functionality. It could be
written as a script, but I see it as a module, so that the implemented
capabilities can be made available to any program.<P>After a couple of hours of coding, we could have 30 to 60 minutes of
discussion, comparing experiences, comparing implementations---after
all, having covered documentation, test-driven programming and pair
programming, we mustn't leave out code-review.<P>

<br><b>Title: Financial Programming with Perl</b>
<br><b>Description:</b>
<br>

How Perl programming interacts with finance (e.g. fixed income and
derivatives).  I'm going to put together a series of Perl applications that
"derive" the key points of modern finance from market data. (E.g. the yield
curve, the market price of risk, implied volatility, volatility smiles.)
Principle learning points:
<ul>
<li> quant finance (non-Perl)
<li> PDL (Perl Data Language -- sort of a MatLab for Perl)
<li> random Perl grab-bag (web interfacing, data acquisition and manipulation)
</ul>

<b>Title:
Testing the Testers
</b>
<br>
<b>Description:</b>
<br>
Test::Builder greatly simplifies the creation of custom testing modules that
plug-in and play nicely with Test::More, Test::Exception and their friends.
Like all code, testing code needs to itself be tested, but how?  It's not
enough to just test that the functions don't die - you need to ensure that
the proper failure and warning outputs are emitted given the proper input.
In this talk, we will create a custom testing module, then explore different
ways of testing it, from rolling your own to using purpose-built modules like
Test::Builder::Tester and Test::Tester.

<b>Title:
Getting your data from there to here: data migration in perl
</b>
<br>
<b>Description:</b>
<br>
Redesigning a database is often a fun and refreshing chance to clean
up and reorganize your data. However, you are often left with a bunch
of data in the legacy database that needs to be migrated from the old
schema to the new one.
<p>
Having solved this problem a few times, and realizing I was going to
have to solve it on an ongoing basis (and that nothing on CPAN did
this yet), I got Lazy and wrote a framework. It uses Class::DBI to
talk to the source and target databases, and YAML to describe the
mappings between them. It supports ongoing synchronization of live
databases, so that even if you have to do a gradual migration, you can
keep the legacy database in production while you bring the new
database on line.
<p>
To paraphrase an oft-quoted description of perl itself, this framework
encapsulates the repeated tasks, and makes the specifics for
particular situations easy to configure. Join me for a tour of the
recently-released Class::DBI::DataMigration.

<p>
This talk is a follow-up to the October 2003 talk presented
to TPM by Richard Dice in which he outlined an MVC framework
for web development in Perl, but didn't actually demonstrate
anything due to the lack of a database backend and working
codebase.
</p>

<p>
After many more months of hacking and improvement and use within a
production system, and numerous huge and impressive patches from Michael
Graham, the system is nigh-ready for widespread release.  It will be
CPANified soon and uploaded to everyone for enjoyment.

<b>Title:
Oysters for your Perls: A theme evening on packaging and distribution
</b>
<br>
<b>Location:  Floor 8, Room 11</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Description:</b>
<p>
A triple bill...
<p>
          "Inject Your Way Out Of Dependency Hell," by Shawn Sorichetti:
           CPAN::Mini::Inject allows you to create your own private CPAN
           site, and include your private modules. Then, you or your
           customers can use CPAN.pm/CPANPLUS.pm for installation,
           ensuring dependencies are properly handled.
<p>
          "Write Once, Find Your Stuff Everywhere - a perl package
           deployment framework for Debian GNU/Linux," by Dan Friedman:
           Some words from Dan on how the use of a private .deb
           repository can make for record-time application rollouts.
           Along the way, he'll talk about leveraging Module::Install,
           YAML, and Debian's "File System Hierarchy" standard to make
           things easier to locate. It's as easy as "apt-get install"!

<p>
          "CPAN bundling for multiple platforms," by James FitzGibbon:
           Supporting eight (or more) distinct platforms when you
           regularly install close to 400 modules per server can
           quickly get out of control.  James will share his
           techniques for distributing the largest number of CPAN
           modules with minimum frustration.

<p>
<b>Who are these guys?</b>

<p>
Shawn Sorichetti works for IBM as a software tools specialist, writing
web based automation and data consolidation applications in Perl.  He
contributes regularly to the WWW::, Test:: and CPAN:: namespaces.

<p>
Dan Friedman is Web/IT Team Lead for TransGaming Technologies, where
he writes truckloads of web apps in perl while maintaining 10 servers
in 4 locations, all running Debian-stable, and juggling 8 flaming
bowling pins and a live sheep. Ok ok, the bowling pins and the sheep
were thrown in there just to make it sound like hard work. Never mind.

<p>
James FitzGibbon is a Perl hacker who, given the choice would go back
to the days of chiseling code into clay tablets.  But since nobody
will pay him to do that, he writes CPAN modules and uses them on
several wildly variant versions of Redhat Linux as well as Solaris.
He is rarely bored.

<b>Title: *&amp;#!perl - Using Perl with Asterisk
</b>
<!--
<br>
<b>Location:  TBA</b>
<br>
-->
<br>
<p>
<b>Description:</b>
<br />
Asterisk is a relatively new open source PBX/IVR/VoIP platform running on
Linux and commodity hardware, promising to have a large impact on the
telecom world by providing a cheap alternative to proprietary solutions.
</p>
<p>
One of it's many strengths is that it allows you to directly interact
with the call logic (dialplans) and the media channels using the AGI
(Asterisk Gateway Interface). This talk will briefly cover Asterisk
dialplans and media channels, then explore building some simple scripts
using the Asterisk::AGI perl module and the different ways Perl can be
invoked from Asterisk.

revised the distribution, but, I'll also try to synthesize what I
learned about maintenance programming in the process."

Title: Using Unison for file synchronization (1 - 1.5 hours)
</b>
<!--
<br>
<b>Location:  TBA</b>
<br>
-->
<br>
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />

<p>
            Unison is a popular file-synchronization tool for Windows
            and most flavors of Unix. It allows two replicas of a
            collection of files and directories to be stored on
            different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
            modified separately, and then brought up to date by
            propagating the changes in each replica to the other. Unlike
            simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with
            updates to both replicas: updates that do not conflict are
            propagated automatically and conflicting updates are
            detected and displayed. Unison is also resilient to failure:
            it is careful to leave the replicas and its own private
            structures in a sensible state at all times, even in case of
            abnormal termination or communication failures.
</p>
<p>

            Martin Cleaver will give an overview of Unison, show it in
            action (fingers crossed) and outline how he uses it to
            provide both a backup of a set of files on a TWiki install
            and two way replica of TWiki from a linux server to his
            laptop using a plugin he wrote for TWiki, the completely
            open source and possibly most popular Wiki implementation
            written in Perl.
</p>
<p>

<b>  About the Speaker:</b>
</p>
<p>

            Martin Cleaver has been a key TWiki Contributor for the past
            4 years and works for a Knowledge Management firm in
            Toronto. He has an BSc/MSc in Computing Science and an
            Masters in Business Administration.

</p>
<p>
            He worked in Messaging Middleware for 3 years for Arthur
            Andersen and will attempt to keep things both humourous and
            technically interesting...

Title: 21st Century Perl (10 minutes)
</b>
<!--
<br>
<b>Location:  TBA</b>
<br>
-->
<br>
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />

<p>
            Every time a new version of Perl comes out, I salivate over
            the shiny new syntax features, but I know that because of
            the demands of backwards compatibility I won't be able to use
            the features for a long time.
</p>
<p>

            But now I'm making a clean break and refusing to support
            Perl versions from the last Millennium.  Suddenly, I get to
            use (with confidence) such advanced features as:

</p>
<ul>
               <li> autovivifying filehandles </li>
               <li> 3 argument open           </li>
               <li> lexical warnings          </li>
               <li> the 'our' pragma          </li>
               <li> can() and isa()           </li>
               <li> inline foreach            </li>
</ul>
<p>
            I'm going to spend about a minute on each of these features,
            and just under 5 minutes ranting about Perl's warnings about
            uninitialized values.

Title: Blinkenlites with Perl : A case study in driving custom
home-made hardware with Perl (60 minutes)
</b>
<br>
<p>
<b>Location:  Classroom 15 on the 8th Floor</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />
<p>
            A demo of a monitoring panel project I use to monitor all my
            Internet goodies with Perl.  The hardware is home-made, and
            quite simple. Basic soldering is all that's really needed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Background:</b>
<br />

<p>
            Like many of you, I'm "responsible" for a number of
            different services on different boxen all around the 'net -
            and getting angry "Our Thingy is Broken!!!" emails is no
            fun.
</p>
<p>
            Having to check your monitoring software to see if
            everything is O.K. when you're on the couch hacking Perl and
            eating pretzels isn't great either.  Laziness tells me I
            should be able to know what's going on by just glancing at
            something that isn't a computer screen.  I need
            blinkenlites!
</p>
<p>
            So I built a little Parallel Port-driven (and powered!)
            monitoring panel and wrote a driver for it in Perl.
            I use it to monitor web services, make sure important
            machines are still online (with ping), and verify that all
            of our Icecast audio streams are still pumping weird music
            to the masses.
</p>
<p>
            I also added a cool ultra-bright blue vanity LED to tell me
            when people are listening to my radio projects.
</p>
<p>
            The driver uses the Device::ParallelPort module, and would
            be super-easy to extend to other monitoring/novelty tasks -
            like checking for new mail, verifying that last night's
            subversion smoke tests all passed or have it blink when your
            favourite web comic strip has posted a new edition. Anything
            that returns true can be used to set/flip the lights on and
            off.  I use WWW::Mechanize and Net::Ping for the actual
            testing.
</p>
<p>
            I've had enormous fun with this project so far, and even the
            most electronically-challenged can build the hardware. It's
            all low-amperage 5 volt, so you should be able handle the
            bare sockets safely under power presuming you are neither
            pregnant nor wearing a pacemaker ;-)
</p>
<p>
            A little soldering is all the electronics know-how required.
            A Multimeter would be a good idea too (or at least a
            continuity tester) to test for shorts before plugging it
            into your computer)

            including a brief overview of OOP coding concepts and
            practices, for use in creating dynamic client/server
            web-apps.

<b>Title: AJAX - Dynamic web sites with DHTML and Perl</b>
<br />

<b>Duration: 30 minutes</b>
<br />


<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />
            How to use the popular Prototype library to fill your web
            application with flashy widgets such as draggable lists,
            autocompleting text boxes and transition effects.  With a
            focus on HTML::Prototype and CGI::Application.

<br />

<b>Duration: 15 minutes</b>
<br />

<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />

            JSAN aims to do for JavaScript what CPAN has done for Perl:
            Encourage modularity, software reuse and good developer
            habits like automated testing.

<b>Speaker #4: John MacDonald</b>
<br />
<b>Title: Migrating from SCCS to CVS</b>
<br />
<b>Duration: 20 minutes </b>
<br />
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />
John will talk about a company's conversion
(in 1992 or 1993) from SCCS to CVS, including:
 <ul>
 <li> what problems they were having</li>
 <li> how CVS solved them</li>
 <li> what problems remained or surfaced during the conversion</li>
 <li> how those remaining problems were dealt with</li>
 <li> some comments on how some new VC systems have provided
   better solutions to some of the problems</li>
</ul>

<b>Speaker #5: Lev Piaseckyj </b>
<br />
<b>Title: Managing a large CVS branch merge </b>
<br />
<b>Duration: 15 minutes </b>
<br />
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />


On a recent, fairly complex multilingual web application
project, the decision was made to fork the code into three
versions. Development took place not only on the CVS trunk,
but also, concurrently, on two independent branches.

<br />
Hundreds of changes -- mainly translation and localization,
but also branch-specific logic -- then had to be merged
from the branches to trunk and vice-versa, without
affecting branch-specific changes. Not a great situation.
<br />

They made use of CVS's history and rdiff commands to assess
the amount of work, and to determine what could be
automated, and what had to be manually reviewed. Then we
used CVS rdiff to generate patches, which were reviewed and
applied.

</p>
<b>Speaker #6: Michael Graham </b>
<br />
<b>Title: SVK for web development </b>
<br />
<b>Duration: 20 minutes </b>
<br />
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>
<br />

This talk will attempt to deal with the issues of
using version control for web development, including:

<ul>
 <li> maintaining multiple per-developer web servers using
   Apache and a local DNS server
 </li>

 <li>  Leaving the designers out at first by keeping their
   content unversioned.  How to manage checkout paths that
   contain versioned and unversioned content
 </li>

 <li>
              using SVN::Notify::Mirror to automatically publish
                changes from the repository to various checkout paths,
                including automatically updating production servers to
                the latest release tag as soon as it is added.
 </li>
 <li>
              Provide simple web interface for designers to create
                release tags
 </li>

 <li>  Getting designers on board and introduce them to
   graphical SVN tools as a replacement for FTP.

<b>Special Guest Speaker: Andy Lester</b>
<br />
<b>Duration: 2 hours</b>
<br />
<b>Location: 2 Bloor Street West, 8th floor, classroom 15</b>
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>

<br />

   Andy Lester has used Perl for over a decade, has written or maintains  a
   number of modules you probably use every day, and works on public
   relations for the Perl Foundation.  But for his double-header talk  for
   October 26th, Perl is barely a mention.
<br />
<br />

   First up, Andy will speak on technical debt and how to get out of  it.
   Technical debt is that nasty condition companies get into where  the
   codebase is crufty, poorly documented, and hard to test, and  everyone is
   terrified of changing anything.  Just like financial  debt, it's the
   compound interest on technical debt that snowballs  until you can no longer
   effectively do projects: technical  bankruptcy. Come learn how to pay down
   your biggest debts before that  happens.
<br />
<br />

   Second, Andy discusses pragmatic job hunting for technical people.   He'll
   talk about how finding and landing a job isn't a matter of  luck, and how
   to make yourself stand out in a sea of job applicants.  Come ready to
   unlearn the conventional wisdom about all aspects of  the job hunt, from
   where to find jobs, how to write a resume, and  what to do in an interview.
   "In my years of hiring programmers, I've  seen some pretty awful mistakes,
   and some awfully funny ones," he  says.  Come learn how to avoid the
   mistakes and get the job you want.
<br />
<br />

   This evening of talks is of general interest to programmers,  sysadmins and
   other technical people, not just Perl Mongers.  Tell  your friends!

<b>Speaker #1: Jim Keenan</b>
<br />
<b>Title: Component-Focused Testing: The Case of the Parrot Build Tools </b>
<br />
<b>Duration: 40 minutes</b>
<br />
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>

<p>
    Installation of an open-source software package such as Perl or a CPAN
    module generally follows a 4-step process: configure, build, test,
    install. Although 'make test' is usually thought of as the place where all
    the testing happens, the successful completion of each of the other stages
    implicitly constitutes the passing of a functional test. But does there
    exist a place for a type of test which is not included in the 'test'
    target but instead is run either before the 'configure' stage or between
    the 'configure' and 'build' stages?
</p>
<p>

    In this talk, Jim argues that there is a role for such tests and he describes
    how he has implemented a number of test suites, run post- configure but
    pre-build, for those of Parrot's build tools written in Perl 5. Such tests
    encourage provide more rapid feedback on the results of refactoring than
    'make test' can. Indeed, they encourage Phalanx-style refactoring which
    makes the build tools more maintainable over the long run.

</p>

<br />

<b>Speaker #2: Henry Baragar  </b>
<br />
<b>Title: Test Driven Design: Or How I Learned to Love the KISS Principle </b>
<br />
<b>Duration: 40 minutes</b>
<br />
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b>

<p>
    Test Driven Development is a practice that can be used to improve software
    quality by writing tests before writing code.  Applied properly, this
    practice can be extended to the design activities as well as code
    construction.  In other words, it is practical to organically grow an
    application from an acorn to a mighty oak without doing any up front
    design work.  
</p>

<p>
    To demonstrate Test Driven Design, Henry will walk through the evolution of a
    real world example.  He will discuss the techniques, examine some
    interesting and unexpected observations, and present statistics from
    personal use.   Finally, the example will be developed using Jifty so that
    you may gain some exposure and insight into this interesting and cutting
    edge application framework.

<b>Title: Richard's Summer of Perl</b>

<br><b>Description:</b>



<p>
             Between May and October Richard did much Perl stuff.
             Conferences attended:  YAPC::NA, OSCON, YAPC::EU and PPW.
</p>             

<p>
             He did a few other Perl things which are hard to categorize
             too.  Come to this talk to hear confessions of a Perl
             addict.  Richard promises only the bare minimum in
             organization and preparation, but will probably have no
             trouble in filling the time allotted, however much that
             time may be before you collectively shout him down.  He
             hopes this talk will be entertaining if informal, maybe
             marginally useful, and at least not overly personally
             embarrassing.

<br />
The concept is simple:  Everybody brings in a wireless-equipped laptop, downloads
Parrot, tries to configure, build and test Parrot, and then tries to
build Rakudo:  the Perl 6 implementation on Parrot.  We see what
obstacles we face in getting to first light and collaborate in
troubleshooting.

Talk 1: Harbinger: Making your desktop sing with the help of Perl
</b>
<br><b>Description:</b>
<br />
<p>

     We use a variety of user interfaces during our day to day lives,
     but what if software you were familiar with suddenly started to
     sing?  Imagine stealing events from your spreadsheets, your
     simulations, your office tools, your editors, even your
     video-games. Could these events make music?  Could the delay and
     reload of a Quake 3 shotgun come out as gong sound?  Could the
     machine gun in Quake3 be converted into an piano roll?  Could the
     frantic scratching of the eraser in GIMP produce beats or the
     shudder of crystal?  With Perl, C, your favorite sound
     generator/player and your exciting or mundane everyday software,
     you too can turn your office or desktop environment into a
     noisemaker.  We present to you Harbinger, a Perl based musical
     event middle man. Harbinger is built to massage events streamed
     from other applications into musical events for software such
     CSound, Pure-Data or hardware attached to your midi ports!

</p>
<b>
Talk 2: Lispy Perl Abstract
</b>
<br><b>Description:</b>
<br />
<p>

     Ever thought of making another language? Ever thought of
     compiling that language down to Perl?  Do you like s-expressions?
     Do you like lisp or scheme? Did you ever want to program in Perl
     in with a different syntax altogether, yet still integrate with
     Perl? In this presentation Abram will demonstrate how to abuse
     Perl's SourceFilter such that you can make it parse a whole new
     language, generate and compile that code and language down to
     Perl Code and execute it.  Why not? Perl has closures, Perl has a
     garbage collector, it might have an attitude problem but throw in
     a couple of parentheses and you've got yourself a flexible
     alternative syntax in which to express ideas. Even better, if it
     compiles down to Perl, you can interact with Perl directly. We'll
     deal with design issues, little quirks of Perl and abuses which
     make developing a language in Perl easier.

Perl golf is a game where the goal is to make a program in the least amount of key "strokes". So you are trying to make the smallest program(not in memory but in length).
