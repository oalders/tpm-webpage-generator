					<h1>What is a CGI request?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>As people became more familiar with the web, they realized that web servers didn't have to restrict themselves to serving simple files that happened to exist on the hard drive
						<li>CGI is the Common Gateway Interface -- it &quot;interfaces&quot; the http request and the web server to a program located at the site
						<li>CGI defines a very simple set of programming conventions such that any program that follows them can be run through any web server that understands CGI
						<ul>
							<li>environment variables and STDIN as input
							<li>STDOUT as output
							<li>&quot;standard URL encoding&quot;, cookies, a few other things as part of input
							<li>as output the program must produce an appropriate &quot;Content-type&quot; header and (probably) HTML
						</ul>
