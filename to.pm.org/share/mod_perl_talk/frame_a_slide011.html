					<h1>Why program Apache API handlers in Perl? Why not use C? (Expanded Answer)</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>If you want to ask this question, you're in the wrong lecture
						<li>This question mainly falls into 2 parts:
						<ul>
							<li>Why program the Apache API at all?
							<li>Why use C over Perl?
						</ul>
						<li>Why program the Apachi API? To fix all the problems that CGI had, and to gain new abilities (already discussed)
						<li>Why program it in Perl rather than C?
						<ul>
							<li>So that you don't have to recompile your Apache httpd binary every time you want to change a printf
							<li>Because Perl is a &quot;nicer&quot; language then C in general
							<li>Because so much of web programming involves manipulating HTTP and HTML, both of which are text, and Perl kicks butt at text manipulation
							<li>Because Perl is great for access to databases, too, via the DBI
							<li>Because of CPAN in general
						</ul>
						<li>Basically, the same reasons you'd want to program in Perl in any possible situation
