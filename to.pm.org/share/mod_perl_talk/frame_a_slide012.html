					<h1>Benefits of mod_perl over CGI</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Essentially, its good points are the opposites of all of the criticism of CGI
						<li>It's fast -- it is loaded when Apache is loaded, because it is part of Apache! You only need to &quot;load&quot; the Perl interpreter once.
						<li>It's fast -- it caches compiled Perl op-codes for any given piece of Perl you run through it
						<li>It's fast -- since it's always around, it can &quot;hold onto&quot; database connections, saving time
						<li>It's more resource-predictable (but still it can have some problems, specifically memory usage due to caching)
						<li>While not itself particularly easy to program, there are many &quot;web toolkits&quot; that build on it that make &quot;CGI-ish&quot; programming much easier
