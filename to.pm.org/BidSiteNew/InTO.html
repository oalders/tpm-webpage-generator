<h2>Getting Around Downtown</h2>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>

Toronto is a notorously safe city. Even in the middle of the night, walking downtown is possible and often even enjoyable as you get to see the "night life" of the city. (Reasonable caution is, of course, always advised.)  Toronto is very much a pedestrian city -- the streets are clean, interesting and welcoming.  Most ammenities are nearby no matter where you are.
</p>


<h3>Public Transit</h3>
<p>

The TTC -- Toronto Transit Commission -- is the second-largest in North America, and the best in terms of availability, reliability, and frequency of service.  The subway permiates the downtown area, and there is an extensive system of "streetcars" (electric trollys on tracks embedded in the road) that's even more ubiquitous.
</p>


<p>
Cash fare is CDN$2.25 per trip (including as many transfers as necessary).  Tokens can be bought;  in packs of 10, the price comes down to CDN$ 1.90 per trip.  A "daypass" can be bought that provides unlimited rides for CDN$ 7.75 (about USD$ 5.50) for a day.
</p>

Rates:

</p>
<ul>
<li>$2.50 Cdn + $0.25 / .235 KM ($1.70 Cdn / mile)
<li>Airport to Downtown: $40 Cdn / $25 US
<li>Typical Downtown Journey: under $10 Cdn/ $7.00 US,  except during rush hour
</ul>
<p>

Under many/most circumstances, taking the TTC (subways and streetcars) will be cheaper and just as fast.

<h3>Driving in Toronto</h3>
<p>

It's possible, but why bother?  Even if you drive to Toronto, do what the Torontonians do.  Park your car and leave it for the time you're here.  Many people with cars just use them to get away to "cottage country" up north on the weekends.
</p>


<p>
Renting a car while you are here is <b>not</b> advised.  It's not that it's too expensive, dangerous, or anything like that.  It's just not necessary. Like any large city, any time you save driving across the city, you use up looking for a parking spot. And you'll spend as much on parking lots as you would have on taxis.
