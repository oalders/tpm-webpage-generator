<h3>From The U.S</h3>
<h4>By Plane</h4>
<p>
While there are several airports serving the Greater Toronto Area, by far the most important is Lester B. Pearson International Airport (airport code <b>YYZ</b>), in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, Ontario.  It is one of the major airports of the world, 10th largest by passenger volume outside of the United States and on par with Seattle's SeaTac and New York's JFK.  Currently, Lester B. Pearson International Airport is undergoing a major renovation effort, the largest capital project currently underway in Canada, with a value of USD$3 billion.  This expansion will create a new "superterminal" that will have the same passenger capacity of all 5 terminals at SFO!  Most of the new superterminal will be operational by the summer of 2004, so expect to be among the first to see it in action.
</p>


<p>
Taxi service is readily available from the airport to the venue and accomodations downtown; expect to pay CDN$ 42 (USD$30) plus 10% tip.  Under non-rush hour traffic conditions the cab ride should take 30-35 minutes.  (Road distance between the airport and downtown is slightly less than 20 miles.)
</p>


<p>
Toronto is the hub city of Air Canada, one of the major airlines of the world and very highly reviewed in many customer satisfaction surveys (tel. 888/247-2262; www.aircanada.ca).  Air Canada operates direct, non-stop flights to Toronto from most major American cities (e.g. over 20 per day to and from New York) and many smaller ones. It also flies from major cities around the world and operates connecting flights from other U.S. cities.
</p>


<p>
Among U.S. airlines, American (tel. 800/433-7300) has daily direct flights from Chicago, Dallas, Miami, and New York. United (tel. 800/241-6522) has direct flights from Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington (Dulles); it's a code-share partner with Air Canada. US Airways (tel. 800/428-4322) operates directly into Toronto from a number of U.S. cities, notably Baltimore, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. Northwest (tel. 800/225-2525) flies direct from Detroit and Minneapolis. Delta (tel. 800/221-1212) flies direct from Atlanta and Cincinnati.
</p>


<h4>By Car</h4>
<p>
Toronto is served by a large network of major (4+ lane, divided, controlled access) highways, most of which are logical extensions of the American InterState system into Ontario and Canada.  The speed limit on these highways is 100 km/h (approximately 65 mph) but usual driving speeds are more like 120 km/h (approximately 75 mph).  There is only one toll highway in all of Ontario;  while it is in the Toronto area it is easily avoided and it unlikely to be used by any people coming into a downtown Toronto location from the United States.  Be prepared to pay a small toll (approx. USD$ 3) on the various bridges coming into Canada from the border points at Buffalo/Ft. Eire, Niagara Falls, Detroit/Windsor or Pt. Huron/Sarnia.  Driving in Canada is essentially the same as driving in the United States;  no special skills or driver's licenses needed.
</p>


<p>
Here are approximate driving distances and times to Toronto from selected major American cities:
