<h1>The Bid In Detail</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>

<img src="Images/city9a.jpg">
</p>


<p>The biggest selling point to a YAPC::NA in Toronto is Toronto
itself. The Greater Toronto Area has a population of around 6 million,
and for the past decade the United Nations has ranked Toronto as the
most multicultural city on Earth. It is remarkably vibrant on every
dimension: the financial district bustles as one of the world's
financial capitals; the array of ethnic neighbourhoods make you feel
like you're visiting a continent, not a city; the street-life --
restaurants, shops, pedestrian concourses -- runs on for miles (well,
kilometres); enough high culture and pop culture that you'd never run
out.
</p>


<p>The proposed facility, University of Toronto, St. Michael's College,
is located in the heart of downtown. A large variety of shops and
restaurants are withing easy walking distance. Convenient and easy
public transport to major attractions is available. Renting a car is
not necessary.
</p>

</p>



<h2>Facilities</h2>
<p>Prices are in Canadian dollars. The quoted costs are for budgetary
purposes only. We should be able to negotiate better terms as a package
deal.
</p>


<p>
Auditorium: Sam Sobara Room, seats 380 persons (250 in banquet mode), $500 per day.
</p>


<p>
Common Area: A common area outside Sam Sobara Room is available.
</p>


<p>Meetings rooms: Theatre Alumni 100, 300 persons, $500 per day.
Theatre Alumni 400, seats 200 persons, $500 per day. Other rooms
capable of holding 60 or 40 people are also available.
</p>


<p>
Terminal room: Available in the library, computers will be included, cost will be about $200 per day.
</p>


<p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<p>
The Sam Sobara residence is only steps away from the meeting rooms. The
building is new and very comfortable.
CDN$55 per night (includes tax), a/c, single occupancy. In-room wired
Internet (ethernet) at $10 per week. Check-in desk open 6am to midnight
7 days a week
</p>


<p>The University of St. Michael's College is in the middle of
downtown. There are over a hundred hotels nearby in either walking or
short trip distance. We will investigate if a group rate can be
negotiated at an appropriate one nearby (e.g. 15 minute walk from the
venue).
</p>


<h2>Equipment: A/V Network</h2>
<p>Wired Internet in all rooms. We will need our own Access Points. LCD
projectors,3, @ $250 per day. P/A system will be provided by the
college at a nominal cost or included in the price of the rooms.
</p>


<h2>Currency Considerations</h2>
<h3>The Exchange Rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>The exchange rate is currently at about 1.38: one dollar US equals about $1.38 Canadian.
</li></ul>
<h3>Using credit and debit cards</h3>
<p>

US Credit and debit cards generally Just Work.  Most banks are on the Cirrus and Plus networks for debit cards.  
</p>


<ul>
<li>Credit cards: You'll be billed your bank's US dollar equivalent to
the CDN dollar amount of your purchase. Keep in mind that the exchange
rate varies day to day.
</li><li>Debit cards: You might want to confirm that your debit card
works by making a withdrawal through some convenient ATM in Toronto. If
your card works at the ATM, it should work as a debit card. (But note
that it would have to be a very strange debit card for it not to work.)
</li></ul>
<h3>Using bank cards for ATM (aka Bank Machine) withdrawals</h3>
<ul>
<li>You'll be offered various amounts in multiples of $20. Your total
withdrawal, plus network charge, will be converted to US dollars and
charged to your account.
</li><li>Note that "white label" ATMs (found in convenience stores)
charge an additional 'service charge'. Try to use a 'bank' ATM if you
want to avoid paying for this service (recommended banks are CIBC,
Royal, Scotiabank, TD/Canada Trust, Bank of Montreal).
</li></ul>
<h3>Using USD$ within Canada</h3>
<ul>
<li>In most places of business you'll see some kind of exchange rate
posted. The rate won't be as high as the official rate, so given an
official rate of 1.38, you might see a rate of 1.25 or 1.30.
</li><li>"U.S. money accepted at par" is not a good deal. :)
</li><li>You can expect to get both American and Canadian coins as change; the exchange rate doesn't apply to coins.
</li><li>If you plan to use US money in a taxi, be sure to negotiate the exchange rate before you start your trip.
</li></ul>
<h3>Traveller's Cheques</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ask before you use them -- some businesses have a stamp for the
'Payee' section of the cheque. Make sure the person accepting the
travellers cheques understands that it's US dollars and not CDN
dollars.
</li><li>They really aren't necessary in this day and age of ATM machines, though.
</li></ul>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="ToTO.html">Travelling to Toronto</a>

<li><a href="InTO.html">Travelling in Toronto</a>
</li></ul>
<h2>Toronto Attractions</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="TorontoAttractions.html">Toronto Attractions</a> and a <a href="TorontoAttractionsMap.html">Map of Downtown Toronto</a>
</li></ul>
<p>One of the biggest attractions to the city is just the atmosphere of
it all. It is a city of neighbourhoods, and the "main streets" of each
will dazzle you with everything that's going on.
</p>


<h2>Planned fun activities</h2>
<p>

Possibilities include:
</p>


<ul>
<li>Toronto Islands BBQ
</li><li>Evening Boat Cruise
</li><li>Toronto International Caravan, a large festival
</li><li>Other touristy events (see above)
</li></ul>
<h2>Conference Team</h2>

<p>Toronto.pm has a <a
href="ConferenceTeam.html">large crew</a> of people
who are willing to put in considerable time and effort to organizer,
produce and execute a YAPC::NA 2004 here in Toronto. More remarkably,
many of our team are from <b>outside</b> Toronto, but eager to
partticipate. Toronto.pm has been active this past year building good
relationships with other nearby Perl Monger groups, such as Ottawa.pm,
Montreal.pm, KW.pm (Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario) and Buffalo.pm. Many
people from these other groups have pledged their support.
