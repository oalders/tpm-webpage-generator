Principle of IndigoStar software and author of 'perl2exe'.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Michael Graham</h3>



<p>
Michael Graham has been programming Perl for 7 years and has produced a couple of CPAN modules.  He has given talks on Testing and Database abstraction, both locally for the Toronto Perl Mongers and also at the 2003 YAPC::Canada in Ottawa.  
</p>


<hr>
<h3>John Macdonald</h3>



<p>
John Macdonald has been involved with Perl back to the days of its early releases on Usenet.  He is the co-author of Mastering Algorithms wirh Perl and has presented talks at The Perl Conference (in 1998 and 2000).
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Tom Legrady</h3>



<p>
Tom tried the new Perl 5 in 95 but was confused by all the backward compatability features. But by 1999 he understood the one-true path: The purpose of C is to provided Perl modules. He is involved in the Toronto art community, including participating in <a href="//www.interaccess.org/aid/">AID</a>, the Art Interface Device, an effort to develop a standard small microcomputer system for artists working with embedded electronics. His day job is as a consultant Perl developer with his company <a href="//www.legrady.ca">Legrady Consulting, Inc.</a>. Tom is aka <em>TomDLux</em> at Perlmonks.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Eric Bower</h3>



<p>
Eric Bower is a newcomer to the Perl world.  He decided to join the Toronto Perl Mongers after another member described his experience with programming in Perl as "fun".  An embedded systems developer, Eric is more comfortable talking bits and bytes to hardware devices using C and assembler languages than the higher and nobler pursuits of Perl programmers.  Although proficient in Visual Basic, he has since learned, through Perl, the proper way to handle strings.  Eric's experience managing music groups, staging two rock concerts in Hamilton and other theatrical productions will help him develop the budget for the Toronto.pm YAPC::NA 2004 bid.
</p>

<h3>Stewart C. Russell</h3>



<p>
Stewart has been working with Perl since 1996, when he discovered how good it was for manipulating tables of wind speed data. Since then, he's worked with Perl in  publishing and financial services. Stewart has been on conference teams before, and may eventually stop talking about his directorship of <a href="//www.windshare.ca/">WindShare</a>, the first urban wind energy co-op in Canada.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>T. Alex Beamish</h3>



<p>
Alex has worked with Perl since 1998 when he started building scripts to write SQL for him. This made a nice transition from programming in C, and he has worked on various web-related projects that use some combination of Perl and SQL since then. He pops up with alarming regularity at <a href="//perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a> under the cunning alias talexb, has been to three YAPCs and hopes to host his fourth.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>KW.pm (Kitchener/Waterloo) Members</h2>
<h3>Daniel Allen</h3>



<p>
Daniel has been a perl programmer since 1997, and has programmed a number of small- and medium-size projects, some of which can be found at <a href="http://coder.com/">http://coder.com/</a>.  He was one of the many people behind the scenes at the inaugural <a href="http://yapc.ca/">http://yapc.ca/</a> in May 2003.
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Stephanie Smith</h3>



<p>
A relative newcomer to perl and YAPC alike, Stephanie has had 3 years of experience in organizing small-to-medium sized conventions, serving as Registration Chair (2 years), Video Programming Chair (1 year), and on the Board of Directors as IT Director (1 year) for the Shoujocon anime convention. 
</p>


<hr>
<h3>Christopher Calzonetti</h3>



<p>
Easily recogonised by his sloping brow and small cranial capacity, Chris is frightened by things new and unfamiliar.  Perl is neither of these things to him.  He is, however, confused and frightened about YAPC but is willing to help out nevertheless.
</p>


<p>
When not sleeping, Christopher tends to work for a Marketing Company doing web design and system administration.
