<p>We normally hold meetings on the last Thursday of each month.</p>

<p>These meetings range from a single Perl theme to code reviews to rambling
free-for-all discussions of things Perlish.  We occasionally have meetings
with special guests lecturing on or teaching about their specialties. 
After the meeting we usually go out for food and drinks.  Perl hackers of
all skill levels are invited.</p>

<p><b>Location</b>: 2 Bloor Street West, (usually) 8th or 16th floor.  The
room number will be announced on the mailing list a few days before the
meeting. It will also be left with the security desk in the building (main
floor lobby) shortly before the meeting starts (i.e. around 6pm).</p>

<p><b>Time</b>: 6:45 p.m.</p>

<p><b>Directions</b>: This building is on the north-west corner of Bloor and
Yonge, accessible by subway from Bloor station. Pay parking is also ample
in this area.</p> 

<p><b>Security note</b>: After 5:30pm, the elevators are accessible only with
a pass-card. After that time a fellow monger with a pass-card will escort
you to the 8th or 16th floor. A cell phone number will be left at the
security desk (main floor lobby) that you can call up to get the
pass-carded TPMer to come down to fetch you.</p>
